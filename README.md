# testgame
This is a github repository for a game that's currently under development. 
Until an official name for this game is decided upon, it will be called "testgame".

## setup

If you would like to play it for yourself, here are instructions for starting the game from one of the release builds:

1. Download the appropriate binary for your operating system, and the pck file.
If you don't know which binary to download, just download the file with the extension which is listed by your operating system below:
- Windows: exe
- GNU/Linux: x86_64
- MacOS: zip

2. Make sure the binary file and the pck file that you downloaded are located in the same folder or directory.

**Note:** Although it is not required, I recommend that you create a new folder or directory specifically for the game's 
files. This is because the game will create save files and configuration files that could cause some clutter. 

3. Run it!
