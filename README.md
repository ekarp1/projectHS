# Project: HS
This is a github repository for a game that's currently under development. 
Until an official name for this game is decided upon, it will be called "Project: HS".

## Setup

If you would like to play it for yourself, here are instructions for starting the game from one of the pre-release builds:

### On Windows

1. Download the files ending in ".exe" and ".pck" from the pre-release build you want to install.

2. Make sure the ".exe" file and the ".pck" file that you downloaded are located in the same folder.

**Note:** Although it is not required, I recommend that you create a new folder specifically for the game's 
files. This is because the game will create save files and configuration files that could cause some clutter. 

3. Run the ".exe" file.

### On MacOS

**Note:** You might have to allow the program to work under "System Preferences"

1. Download the file ending in ".zip" from the pre-release build you want to install

2. Double click on the ".zip" file in order to unarchive it.

3. Run the program.

### On GNU/Linux

1. Download the files ending in ".x86_64" and ".pck" from the pre-release build you want to install.

2. Make sure the ".x86_64" file and the ".pck" file that you downloaded are located in the same directory.

**Note:** Although it is not required, I recommend that you create a new directory specifically for the game's 
files. This is because the game will create save files and configuration files that could cause some clutter. 

3. Mark the ".x86_64" file as an executable using the following command (replace "filename" with the file's name):

```
chmod +x filename.x86_64
```

4. Run the ".x86_64" file.

### On Android

**Note:** The android version is still in it's earliest stages of development, but you can still try it on any pre-release build since version 0.2.0 beta.

1. Download the file ending in ".apk" from the pre-release build you want to install.

2. Install it in the same way you would install any apk file on an android device.
